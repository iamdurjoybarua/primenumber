# Prime Number Checker (C)

This C program determines whether a given number is a prime number.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer greater than 1. It then checks if the number is prime and displays the result.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code in a file named `primechecker.c` (or any other name with a `.c` extension).

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc primechecker.c -o primechecker
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `primechecker` (or `primechecker.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./primechecker  # On Linux/macOS
    primechecker.exe # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter a number. Enter a positive integer greater than 1 and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will display whether the entered number is a prime number or not.
